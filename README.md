# Libstats

This bot allows you to view library statistics directly in discord.

The bot uses:
1. beautifulsoup4
2. requests
3. grequests

library's to get data from these sites:
1. https://pypistats.org
2. https://api.pepy.tech/api/v2/{projects/name}
3. https://github.com

Each time we will experiment to make the bot more convenient, optimized, faster.  
If you want to support this work, you can leave a star :)
